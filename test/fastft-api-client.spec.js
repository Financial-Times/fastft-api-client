Bloomberg News.<\/a>. <\/p>\n\\n<p>To put that $5bn figure into context, that\'s about 5 times the amount BNP Paribas has set aside for potential penalties in the case, which, according to people familiar with the probe, centers on the lenders\' past dealings with countries such as Iran and Sudan. <\/p>\n\\n<p>It also represents about 75 per cent of the French bank\'s total net income of
