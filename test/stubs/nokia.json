Nokia plans to return \u20ac3bn to shareholders through a resumption of its dividend (cut last year for the first time in its 148-year history), a special pay-out and a share buyback programme. The sum is made up of ordinary dividends of \u20ac400m for 2013 and 2014 as well as a special dividend of about \u20ac1bn and a buyback programme of \u20ac1.25bn.

Rajeev Suri, the current head of the new Nokia's biggest division NSN, will be the new chief executive.
