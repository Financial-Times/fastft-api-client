The Finnish company has unveiled its new chief executive, strategy and structure in a blizzard of news. Here is the cheat sheet, from the <strong>FT's Nordic Correspondent Richard Milne<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Dividend<\/strong>. Nokia plans to return \u20ac3bn to shareholders through a resumption of its dividend (cut last year for the first time in its 148-year history), a special pay-out and a share buyback programme. The sum is made up of ordinary dividends of \u20ac400m for 2013 and 2014 as well as a special dividend of about \u20ac1bn and a buyback programme of \u20ac1.25bn. In addition, Nokia said it wanted to reduce its debt by \u20ac2bn in the next two years.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chief executive<\/strong>.

NSN represents about 90 per cent of the new Nokia's revenues. \"As Nokia opens this new chapter, the Nokia Board and I are confident that Rajeev is the right person to lead the company forward,\" Risto Siilasmaa, Nokia's chairman, said in a statement.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Strategy<\/strong>.

They are: telecoms equipment capable of handling a huge increase in the number of devices and data usage; location services; innovation, including in sensing, radio and low power technologies.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Structure<\/strong>. Not surprisingly, this new strategy coincides with the three divisions it has: Networks (the old NSN business), its Here mapping business, and what it calls its Technologies unit, which consists of its patents portfolio.
