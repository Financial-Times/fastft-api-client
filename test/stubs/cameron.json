IPO","type":"article","status":"live","url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/fastft?post=168772","shorturl":"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/1iFLDI8\n","content":"<p>Volution, the latest property related business to take advantage of Britain's frothy housing market, has priced its London IPO, valuing the business at \u00a3300m. <\/p>\n\n<p>The ventilation product maker's IPO is expected to raise \u00a3100m for the company and selling shareholders, including its private equity backer TowerBrook Capital. <\/p>\n\n<p>Volution is one of a flurry of construction related companies to have tapped the equity markets recently, including listing website <a href=\"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/1pfKRY8\">Zoopla<\/a> and plastic pipe supplier Polypipe. <\/p>\n\n<p>It may also be hoping to attract some patriotic investors too, after winning praise from David Cameron for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vent-axia.com\/news\/latest-news\/british-manufacturer-vent-axia-welcomes-prime-minister-david-cameron-24-jan-2014.htm\">bringing some manufacturing back<\/a> to Britain from China. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the year to the end of July, Volution had revenues of \u00a3102m \u2013 up about 14 per cent on the prior year \u2013 and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of \u00a324m, a rise of 10 per cent.<\/p>\n\n<p>The company will make its market debut with a stock price of 150p per share, it said in a statement, with dealing to commence on June 23. <\/p>\n\n<p>On admission, TowerBrook will be interested in approximately 61.4 per cent of the company's shares, which are subject to a 180 day lock-up.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7<\/p>","abstract":"<p>Volution, the latest property related business to take advantage of Britain's frothy housing market, has priced its London IPO, valuing the business at
