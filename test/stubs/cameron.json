She received child benefits worth a total of \u20ac317 per month, which are easily accessed in Germany, but was refused unemployment support when the authorities decided that she was not actively seeking a job. The 25-year old has no professional qualifications, little education and does not speak German.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ECJ declared that the Romanian woman and her son \"cannot claim a right of residence in Germany\" as they do not have sufficient resources to support themselves.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rise of so-called \"benefit tourism\" within the EU has been highlighted as a major problem by leaders such as British prime minister David Cameron. However, member states have so far come forward with little evidence of its widespread existence. Earlier this year, the former European commissioner for employment Laszlo Andor accused Mr Cameron of peddling \"myths\" on the topic.<\/p>\n\n<p>The judgement on Tuesday will come as a relief to German officials, who generally expected the European court to uphold earlier German rulings. The ECJ advocate general offered an opinion earlier this year that countries could reject benefit claims by citizens of other EU countries if the applicants are not seriously looking for work.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ruling will allow the German government to press on with planned laws to clamp down on welfare abuse. While there is no direct legal link between the judgement and these proposals, an adverse ruling would have made it more difficult politically to pursue new measures without a time-consuming review of the ECJ judgement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although free movement of people within the EU is guaranteed by the organisation's treaties, rules on who can claim benefits are less clear. Some countries, such as Belgium, have sent letters to out-of-work EU migrants demanding that they leave the country as they had become \"an unreasonable burden\" - a move that is within EU rules. But other governments, such as the UK, have complained that EU laws leave little room to limit access to benefits for migrants from elsewhere in the bloc.<\/p>","abstract":"<p>EU citizens who enter another country \"solely\" to claim benefits can be excluded from welfare schemes, according to a judgement by the European Court of Justice.<\/p>","datepublished":"1415697221","authorpseudonym":"Chris Nuttall","currentrevision":5882212,"attachments":[],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"113072"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"EU","id":86092,"tagid":86092,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:EU","classname":null},{"tag":"David Cameron","id":88992,"tagid":88992,"tx":"Person","txprefix":"person","txid":4020,"query":"person:\"David Cameron\"","classname":null}],"uuidv3":"df0ccf45-9f4c-3757-a59f-53b4c46c5c23","sortval":"0-0-01415697221"},{"id":233982,"title":"Budget grocer Aldi to create 35,000 UK jobs","type":"article","status":"live","url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/fastft?post=233982","shorturl":"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/1ATwuRr\n","slug":"budget-grocer-aldi-create-35000-uk-jobs","content":"<p>Aldi, the German discount supermarket which has been winning market share from UK giants such as Tesco, says it will create 35,000 jobs in the next eight years.<\/p>\n\n<p>The announcement, timed to coincide with today's CBI conference in London, is linked to its expansion target of 1,000 UK stores by 2022 - a net addition of 550 stores currently.<\/p>\n\n<p>The supermarket will invest a total of \u00a3600m in its expansion at a time when more established rivals are scaling back their store opening plans.<\/p>\n\n<p>UK prime minister David Cameron met Aldi's group managing directors Matthew Barnes and Roman Heini at the grocer's UK headquarters in Atherstone, where he was informed of the plans.
