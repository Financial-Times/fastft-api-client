Its performance in fixed income, commodities and currencies or Ficc trading was better than expected, as revenues rose by about 4 per cent - bucking the Wall Street trend (down 9 per cent on average) - as investors lap up yield products in a classic case of make hay while you can.<\/p>\n\n<p>Investors need to reflect on the quality \u2013 including the sustainability - of that beat, however. As quantitative easing is unwound, the cheap money chasing yield in Europe could soon crumble. Wisely, Credit Suisse is already pulling out of its sub-scale commodities trading activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>A pity then that Credit Suisse's core equities franchise reported such a dip (more than 18 per cent off last year's admittedly high base) in equity trading revenues in the business being kept, standing out as one of the main drags on underlying earnings.<\/p>\n\n<p>And costs in the investment banking area are still relatively high \u2013 a reminder that Credit Suisse CEO Brady Dougan still has more to do to restructure his bank \u2013 though there is clear progress in automation of foreign exchange trading and rationalisation of its rates products.<\/p>\n\n<p>And while Credit Suisse looks to be on track to hit its end-2015 cost reduction target of over SFr4.5bn, it may need to add more stretch to those targets given the uncertainty in investment banking markets. No cigar yet for the investment bankers, then.<\/p>\n\n<p>That leaves Credit Suisse's private banking and wealth franchise to support the group \u2013 or not, as it turns out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although it attracted SFr10bn of net inflows \u2013 a level not surpassed since the first quarter of 2013 - revenue in the area that is increasingly being shaped as the group's core (\u00e0 la UBS) slipped by a worse than expected 9 per cent in the business being kept.<\/p>\n\n<p>It gets worse: Credit Suisse's closely-watched gross margin fell again \u2013 to a worse-than-expected 99 basis points, from 112bp a year ago, partly as assets under management swelled.<\/p>\n\n<p>And though Credit Suisse's peer-lagging Basel III capital ratio of 9.5 per cent looks on track to beat 10 per cent by year-end, Mr Dougan still needs to shrink leverage in his investment bank. Risk-weighted assets, for example, declined only to SFr279bn from SFr281bn a year earlier.

deal","type":"article","status":"live","url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/fastft?post=184522","shorturl":"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/Wva3Qh\n","content":"<p>It was a classic Saudi announcement: years of rumours and inertia, followed by an unheralded, obtuse statement in Arabic on the website of a state body that was so discrete that most media only picked up on its importance the day after it was posted.<\/p>\n\n<p>But Saudi Arabia planning to open up its $530bn stock market to foreigners is potentially a big deal \u2013 for both the country and emerging markets as a whole.<\/p>\n\n<p>The country's Capital Markets Authority has allowed foreign investors indirect access through \"total return swaps\" since 2008, but many money managers have been reluctant to use these derivatives, as they only entitle the holders to the economic benefits of share ownership, rather than actual control.<\/p>\n\n<p>Direct access, through a China-style \"qualified foreign financial institutions\" system, could be a game-changer. The Saudi Arabian Tadawul has a market capitalisation of $530bn, making it a bigger stock market than Mexico, Indonesia and the Netherlands, in line with Malaysia and South Africa, and bigger than Colombia and Chile combined. <\/p>\n\n<p>If it is eventually included in stock market indices, it would become an important part of benchmarks. Renaissance Capital's Daniel Salter estimates that it would form almost two-thirds of the MSCI Frontier Markets index, or 4.4 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Markets gauge, about the same as Russia. <\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Saudi Arabia's market is extremely liquid for a recondite, off-piste bourse. Renaissance Capital's Charles Robertson puts the three-month average daily trading volume at $2bn, compared to just $26m for Nigeria last year. <\/p>\n\n<p>The dominance of retail investors means that it is an exceptionally volatile market, but part of the reason why Saudi Arabia is now opening up is that it hopes more longer-term institutional investment will dampen the Tadawul's wild swings. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since a brutal crash in 2006 \u2013 which bankrupted many Saudis who had ploughed their savings into the bourse, and triggered some social strife \u2013 the regulator has sharpened its teeth and clamped down on pump-and-dump schemes, insider trading and other market abuses. The CMA is now one of the more respected regulators in the Gulf. <\/p>\n\n<p>Adding to the lustre is Saudi Arabia's economic potential. Although oil remains the country's dominant industry and source of revenue, the government is ploughing money into various parts of the economy to diversify its output. <\/p>\n\n<p>The exact timing remains unclear, and Saudi Arabia has a tendency to move slowly. Local officials indicated an opening up to the FT in 2012, but little happened. But the potential is immense. As Mr Robertson noted:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is long awaited and is likely to see a surge of foreign inflows into the Saudi market \u2013 particularly if\/when it joins an MSCI index. It is a rival for money that might otherwise be invested in Russia, which is one reason Rencap is opening up in MENA in 2014. Our MENA team is very excited.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","abstract":"<p>It was a classic Saudi announcement: years of rumours and inertia, followed by an unheralded, obtuse statement in Arabic on the website of a state body that was so discrete that most media only picked up on its importance the day after it was posted.<\/p>\n\n<p>But Saudi Arabia planning to open up its $530bn stock market to foreigners is potentially a big deal \u2013 for both the country and emerging markets as a whole.<\/p>","datepublished":"1406019229","authorpseudonym":"Robin Wigglesworth","currentrevision":4870552,"attachments":[{"id":105892,"postid":184522,"userid":24502,"title":"Capture.PNG","path":"\/2014-07\/22\/Capture.PNG","mimetype":"image\/png","size":405384,"content":"<div class='formatted-img' data-src='http:\/\/clamo.ftdata.co.uk\/files\/2014-07\/22\/Capture.PNG'><\/div>"}],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"113092"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"Gulf States","id":98552,"tagid":98552,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:\"Gulf States\"","classname":null},{"tag":"Saudi Arabia","id":98782,"tagid":98782,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:\"Saudi Arabia\"","classname":null},{"tag":"Comment","id":113092,"tagid":113092,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:Comment","classname":"purple"}],"uuidv3":"6db206d9-f12b-3528-812b-84376e57b090","sortval":"0-0-01406019229"}],"srh":{"query":{"id":1001,"str":"","url":"","obj":null,"hash":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"},"sort":"date","limit":10,"offset":0,"dispopts":[]},"resultsummarytext":"16,891 results","total":16891,"filters":{"4000":{"id":4000,"name":"Topic","plural":"Topics","terms":{"1":{"tagid":"86032","freq":3339,"type":"inresults","tag":"Economy","term":"topic:Economy","isprotected":0},"0":{"tagid":"86352","freq":4130,"type":"inresults","tag":"Markets","term":"topic:Markets","isprotected":0}},"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4010":{"id":4010,"name":"Sector","plural":"Sectors","terms":[{"tagid":"113002","freq":7630,"type":"inresults","tag":"Companies","term":"sector:Companies","isprotected":0},{"tagid":"88632","freq":249,"type":"inresults","tag":"Retail","term":"sector:Retail","isprotected":0}],"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4020":{"id":4020,"name":"Person","plural":"People","terms":{"1":{"tagid":"89052","freq":129,"type":"inresults","tag":"Ben Bernanke","term":"person:\"Ben Bernanke\"","isprotected":0},"0":{"tagid":"114882","freq":163,"type":"inresults","tag":"Janet Yellen","term":"person:\"Janet Yellen\"","isprotected":0}},"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4030":{"id":4030,"name":"Location","plural":"Locations","terms":{"1":{"tagid":"98262","freq":1581,"type":"inresults","tag":"Asia","term":"location:Asia","isprotected":0},"0":{"tagid":"119052","freq":2423,"type":"inresults","tag":"US","term":"location:US","isprotected":0}},"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4040":{"id":4040,"name":"Institution","plural":"Institutions","terms":{"1":{"tagid":"100282","freq":251,"type":"inresults","tag":"ECB","term":"institution:ECB","isprotected":0},"0":{"tagid":"113542","freq":323,"type":"inresults","tag":"Federal Reserve","term":"institution:\"Federal Reserve\"","isprotected":0}},"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4050":{"id":4050,"name":"Company","plural":"Companies","terms":[{"tagid":"101432","freq":203,"type":"inresults","tag":"Apple","term":"company:Apple","isprotected":0},{"tagid":"101332","freq":175,"type":"inresults","tag":"RBS","term":"company:RBS","isprotected":0}],"iscomplete":false,"summary":""}}}}]
