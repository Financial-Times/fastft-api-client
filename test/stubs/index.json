A month later, RBS now accepts that GRG was a profit centre after all.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>RBS had not objected to the term 'profit centre' when given extensive opportunity to comment on drafts of Sir Andrew's report last year. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Yet it decided to contest the term in evidence to the Committee, not only in a written statement in February, but also repeatedly in its public hearing in June. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Following the Committee's decision to write to Sir Andrew Large for clarification, RBS has now offered the Committee what it euphemistically describes as 'additional comments'. In fact, they have done a belated U-turn. It's not as if the facts have changed. So it now appears that RBS has been wilfully obtuse with the Committee.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>If this is how RBS deals with a parliamentary Committee, how much can customers and regulators rely on it to be straightforward with them?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So far, so political point scoring. <\/p>\n\n<p>But is that what RBS actually said? <\/p>\n\n<p>We'll let readers judge for themselves. Here's the full excerpt from RBS's explanatory letter to the committee - emphais ours: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Firstly, with regard to the term of 'profit centre' we wish to make clear we do not disagree with the way that that accounting term was used by Sir Andrew Large in his report. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Sir Andrew clearly set out his definition for that accounting term in his glossary and it is indeed the case that the financial performance of GRG was monitored to enable us to understand GRG'S financial performance.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>This is a standard accounting practice across all sectors of our business (for example our Property Service division, which exists to support amongst other things our branch network, can also be classified as a profit centre by virtue of its recordings of assets, as well as costs and income).<\/strong> <\/p>\n  \n  <p>However, what Mr Sach and I were taking issue with is the way others have used Sir Andrew's report to suggest that GRG had a profit motive with a prejudice against our customers, rather than a turnaround motive. <strong>Indeed as Mr Sach pointed out in his evidence, far from making any profit for the bank, GRG has recorded a substantial loss over recent years.<\/strong> <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Put simply, GRG deals with many customers who cannot service their debts, leading to losses for the bank.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","abstract":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland once again on the naughty step this morning.<\/p>","datepublished":"1406035418","authorpseudonym":"Megan Murphy","currentrevision":4875072,"attachments":[],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"113002"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"Andrew Tyrie","id":93902,"tagid":93902,"tx":"Person","txprefix":"person","txid":4020,"query":"person:\"Andrew Tyrie\"","classname":null},{"tag":"UK","id":98232,"tagid":98232,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:UK","classname":null},{"tag":"RBS","id":101332,"tagid":101332,"tx":"Company","txprefix":"company","txid":4050,"query":"company:RBS","classname":null},{"tag":"Companies","id":113002,"tagid":113002,"tx":"Sector","txprefix":"sector","txid":4010,"query":"sector:Companies","classname":"blue-2"}],"uuidv3":"74332dbb-630c-3499-96bf-f5f6740f5d79","sortval":"0-0-01406035418"},{"id":184712,"title":"Saudi bourse rises to 6-year high on reform talk","type":"article","status":"live","url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/fastft?post=184712","shorturl":"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/WweSZx\n","slug":"saudi-market-climbs-6-year-high-on-reform-talk","content":"<p>Saudi Arabia's market has climbed to a six-year high on the authorities' plans to open up the bourse to direct foreign investment for the first time, a move that would likely entice a slew of money managers keen to tap into the oil-rich economy.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Tadawul All-Shares index has gained 2.9 per cent today \u2013 the biggest advance in over three years and the best performance of any market in the world today. <\/p>\n\n<p>The move has been long-rumoured, but has been slowed down for years by Saudi Arabia's conservatism and entrenched inertia (a mortgage law has been in limbo for almost a decade). <\/p>\n\n<p>The government said late on Monday that it has allowed the Capital Markets Authority to grant foreigners the right to buy and sell shares \"at a time it sees as appropriate\".

It left serious cost-cutting far too late to get ahead of the falling cycle, and its hands are in any case tied by a government intent on avoiding the job losses the industry has long required amid so much surplus capacity.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trouble for Lonmin, as a smaller contender in the market that Amplats dominates, is that it has even less financial wiggle room than Anglo. In recent memory, it has lumbered from crisis to crisis, its progress punctuated by rights issues to puncture debt boils, and it ultimately relies for its long-run survival on Amplats shedding capacity.<\/p>\n\n<p>That seems ever more unlikely to happen given that Amplats is merely <a href=\"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/1tpfWsU\">trying to exit unprofitable deep-level mines<\/a> the better to concentrate on its mechanised Mogalakwena mine and other more promising assets. Low-margin capacity will be replaced by higher-margin stuff. Amplats even plans to exit its ominously-named Pandora joint venture with Lonmin. <\/p>\n\n<p>A further factor weighing on Lonmin is the as yet unknown intention of Glencore with regard to its 24.5 per cent stake. It is hard to imagine that it is a keeper in the long run.<\/p>\n\n<p>And, its beyond operational challenges, that is another uncertainty for Lonmin in an industry that is crying out for proper consolidation. As we <a href=\"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/Wpu1Me\">said yesterday<\/a>, the Amplats platinum assets are not the only ones on the market.<\/p>\n\n<p>While Mr Beamish gets a grip on these issues, investors are left to look for signs that CEO Ben Magara is indeed on his way to building a \"robust and sustainable Lonmin\", with a first glimpse of that when the miner releases its third quarter production report and interim management statement on Friday.
