a big ask possibly for a central government that is currently propping up quite a few of them.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Spanish government has supported the fairly autonomous regions through a facility called Fondo de Liquidez Autonomico, or FLA. Regions will have to start repaying the loans this autumn, but Moody's predicts that many of the more stricken regions will have to continue to rely on a combination of the FLA, bank loans and bond sales. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A return to pre-financial-crisis market access for regions is possible, but we expect that regions are likely to borrow from both government facilities and the market\/ banks. Even with further consolidation, some fiscally weaker regions will still require favourable borrowing conditions under a government funding scheme. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>However, as regions rebalance their budgets, we believe that the government is likely to launch a \"reformed\" FLA that carries no fiscal\/debt conditionality, and which would thereby become an option for all regions.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Some of the stronger regions, like the Basque country and Madrid, already enjoy easy access to markets, but overall the Spanish sub-sovereigns have financing requirements of \u20ac34bn this year, \u20ac29bn in 2015 and \u20ac24bn in 2016, the rating agency estimates. <\/p>\n\n<p>The breakdown can be seen in the chart below.<\/p>","abstract":"<p>Spain's indebted regions should be able to regain access to bond markets over the next few years as long as economic growth and fiscal consolidation does not disappoint, Moody's predicted in a report.<\/p>","datepublished":"1402480227","authorpseudonym":"Robin Wigglesworth","currentrevision":4523132,"attachments":[{"id":97262,"postid":165852,"userid":24502,"title":"Capture.PNG","path":"\/2014-06\/11\/Capture.PNG","mimetype":"image\/png","size":30773,"content":"<div class='formatted-img' data-src='http:\/\/clamo.ftdata.co.uk\/files\/2014-06\/11\/Capture.PNG'><\/div>"}],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"86352"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"Markets","id":86352,"tagid":86352,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:Markets","classname":"orange-2"},{"tag":"Spain","id":98402,"tagid":98402,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:Spain","classname":null},{"tag":"Madrid","id":99032,"tagid":99032,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:Madrid","classname":null},{"tag":"Moody's","id":104562,"tagid":104562,"tx":"Company","txprefix":"company","txid":4050,"query":"company:Moody's","classname":null},{"tag":"Catalonia","id":121552,"tagid":121552,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:Catalonia","classname":null}],"uuidv3":"d6626ce5-d322-3dcd-8808-f44aa4373a90","sortval":"0-0-01402480227"},{"id":165832,"title":"Iraq to up oil production despite Mosul -
