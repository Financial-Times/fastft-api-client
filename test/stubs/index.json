Sweden's central bank cut its main interest rate in July to just 0.25 per cent to ward off deflation risks.\nSwedbank can box around that to a point. But as low inflation heaps pressure on the Riksbank to cut rates further, the Swedish lender must keep cutting costs and boost productivity to buttress returns.<\/p>\n\n<p>Excising between 600-800 jobs over two years \u2013 in effect, not replacing the 5.5 per cent of staff who leave or retire - is the way to go.<\/p>\n\n<p>A further reason for discipline now is the uncertainty created by the upheaval in Ukraine, though Swedbank has not yet felt any knock-on effects in its Baltic business.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even so, Swedbank's bad loan charge ticked up to SKr235m in the quarter. That's still a negligible proportion of its overall lending, but is one to watch.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for revenue, net interest income was 3 per cent higher, the result of repricing mortgages and increasing lending volumes as the Swedish property market keeps rising. Fee income was resilient, increasing by 12 per cent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although expenses were 4 per cent higher overall, they climbed more slowly than expected. And luckily a 10 per cent increase in total income meant that it cost Swedbank just 41 oere to generate every krona of income, pulling down its cost-to-income ratio from 47 per cent in the second quarter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Few investors will worry about Swedbank's common equity tier one ratio of 20.7 per cent. But as the Swedish property prices rise amid a housing shortage in urban areas and high household indebtedness a hot topic \u2013 a plump capital cushion is no bad thing. It's not as if Swedbank's loan-to-value ratio is remotely buccaneering.<\/p>\n\n<p>Its shares trade at more than twice its tangible book value, so investors certainly pay up for the capital safety and resilience of Swedbank. But few lenders in the European landscape offer both of those plus an underlying return on equity of 16.6 per cent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not yet future-proof perhaps, but the next best thing.<\/p>","abstract":"<p>Way to go.<\/p>","datepublished":"1413888912","authorpseudonym":"RichardStovinBradford","currentrevision":5664002,"attachments":[],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"113092"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"European banks","id":87052,"tagid":87052,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:\"European banks\"","classname":null},{"tag":"Sweden","id":98712,"tagid":98712,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:Sweden","classname":null},{"tag":"Swedbank","id":108902,"tagid":108902,"tx":"Company","txprefix":"company","txid":4050,"query":"company:Swedbank","classname":null},{"tag":"Earnings","id":112892,"tagid":112892,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:Earnings","classname":null},{"tag":"Comment","id":113092,"tagid":113092,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:Comment","classname":"purple"},{"tag":"Riksbank","id":128782,"tagid":128782,"tx":"Institution","txprefix":"institution","txid":4040,"query":"institution:Riksbank","classname":null},{"tag":"property","id":128932,"tagid":128932,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:property","classname":null}],"uuidv3":"bcc95a1a-be43-3b16-8d2d-a3d2c2c9d87f","sortval":"0-0-01413888912"},{"id":223932,"title":"US earnings season: sales surprise, outlook dims","type":"article","status":"live","url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/fastft?post=223932","shorturl":"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/1FvPzcm\n","slug":"post-223932","content":"<p>As third-quarter US earnings season shifts into a faster gear on Tuesday, a quick snapshot of what corporate America has delivered so far.<\/p>\n\n<p>The proportion of S&amp;P 500 companies eclipsing earnings estimates is running at 69 per cent which, according to analysts at Barclays, is in line with recent quarters.<\/p>\n\n<p>The tally for those businesses topping for revenues is 64 per cent, shy of the second-quarter but better than the recent trend of 58 per cent.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's worth pointing out that Wall Street analysts gradually trimmed revenue and profit expectations in the countdown to third-quarter earnings, giving companies an easier bar to hurdle.<\/p>\n\n<p>What's more, analysts are already cutting estimate for the profits (measured by earnings per share) they expect S&amp;P 500 companies to make in 2015 (see chart below) as global growth weakens.<\/p>","abstract":"<p>As third-quarter US earnings season shifts into a faster gear on Tuesday, a quick snapshot of what corporate America has delivered so far.<\/p>","datepublished":"1413888878","authorpseudonym":"Richard Blackden","currentrevision":5663972,"attachments":[{"id":127722,"postid":223932,"userid":24302,"title":"SPXOCT1.PNG","path":"\/2014-10\/21\/SPXOCT1.PNG","mimetype":"image\/png","size":76167,"content":"<div class='formatted-img' data-src='http:\/\/clamo.ftdata.co.uk\/files\/2014-10\/21\/SPXOCT1.PNG'><\/div>"}],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"86352"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"Markets","id":86352,"tagid":86352,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:Markets","classname":"orange-2"},{"tag":"Europe","id":98242,"tagid":98242,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:Europe","classname":null},{"tag":"Asia","id":98262,"tagid":98262,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:Asia","classname":null},{"tag":"Earnings","id":112892,"tagid":112892,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:Earnings","classname":null},{"tag":"US","id":119052,"tagid":119052,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:US","classname":null}],"uuidv3":"8b236a2f-3e43-3916-a8eb-f4e6311187b9","sortval":"0-0-01413888878"},{"id":223902,"title":"Tesco trading resilient over past month -

The two sentences would run\nconcurrently.<\/p>\n\n<p>In making her ruling, Judge Masipa said she wanted a sentence that was\nfair and just to both society and the accused. <\/p>\n\n<p>She said a\nnon-custodial sentence \"would send the wrong message to the\ncommunity,\" while adding that \"on the other hand a long sentence would\nnot be appropriate as it would lack the element of mercy\".<\/p>\n\n<p>It is a trial that has borne witness to the spectacular fall from grace of one of the world's most recognisable athletes: a double-amputee who earned iconic status in South Africa and beyond after competing against able-bodied track stars in the 2012 London Olympics. <\/p>\n\n<p>During the sentencing process last week, Mr Pistorius's defence described the 27-year-old as a broken man. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"He was an icon for what he has achieved. He's lost everything. He lost all his sponsors. He lost all his money,\" Barry Roux, defence lawyer, told the court in Pretoria, South Africa's capital. \"He has nothing. There is nothing left of this man.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Mr Roux had argued that Mr Pistorius \u2013 dubbed the \"blade-runner\" because of the distinct carbon fibre blades he runs on - should be given community service. He said he had been punished enough and shown remorse for shooting to death Reeva Steenkamp, his girlfriend, during the early hours of Valentine's Day last year. <\/p>\n\n<p>But the prosecution countered that Mr Pistorius should be jailed for a minimum of 10 years. In South Africa, the sentence for culpable homicide can range from a fine to lengthy imprisonment.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"We shouldn't fail the parents. We shouldn't fail society,\" Gerrie Nel, the leader prosecutor, said ahead of the sentencing. \"Society may lose its trust in the court.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>During the arguments, South Africa's overcrowded prison system was effectively put on trial, with the defence claiming that Mr Pistorius's disabilities would make him particularly vulnerable in prison. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mr Pistorius was born without fibula bones in his legs but overcame his disabilities to become a global star. Most notably, he reached the semi-finals of the 400 metres at the London Olympics after fighting for his right to run against able-bodied athletes, while also helping bring unprecedented attention to the Paralympics. <\/p>\n\n<p>But less than a year later, he made international headlines for all the wrong reasons when police where called to his home in a wealthy suburb of Pretoria in the early hours of February 14 2013. <\/p>\n\n<p>They discovered that Mr Pistorius had killed Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and law graduate, by firing the 9mm pistol he kept by his bed four times through the locked toilet door of an en-suite bedroom. <\/p>\n\n<p>In his defence, Mr Pistorius has insisted that the killing was a terrible accident after he mistakenly thought an intruder had entered his house through a bathroom window. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/584cabe8-39ac-11e4-83c4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3GhN3GLhz\">In her judgement last month, Judge Masipa<\/a> criticised Mr Pistorius as a poor and evasive witness. But in finding him not guilty of murder, she decided that he genuinely believed that someone had broken into the house at the time of the shooting and posed a risk to him and Steenkamp.<\/p>\n\n<p>The judgement sparked a swirl of controversy in South Africa, with some legal experts and commentators questioning her decision to acquit Mr Pistorius of murder. <\/p>\n\n<p>There has also been speculation that either the defence or prosecution could appeal, depending on the sentencing. <\/p>","abstract":"<p>Oscar Pistorius, the South African Olympic and Paralymic star, has\nbeen sentenced to five years in jail for the culpable homicide, or manslaughter, \nof his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.<\/p>","datepublished":"1413880649","authorpseudonym":"Robin Wigglesworth","currentrevision":5662252,"attachments":[],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"113072"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"South Africa","id":98682,"tagid":98682,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:\"South Africa\"","classname":null},{"tag":"World News","id":113072,"tagid":113072,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:\"World News\"","classname":"turquoise"},{"tag":"Oscar Pistorius","id":134132,"tagid":134132,"tx":"Person","txprefix":"person","txid":4020,"query":"person:\"Oscar Pistorius\"","classname":null}],"uuidv3":"9ac88051-2486-308a-9c72-88a733845823","sortval":"0-0-01413880649"},{"id":223802,"title":"Markets open higher, ignoring Asian weakness","type":"article","status":"live","url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/fastft?post=223802","shorturl":"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/1Fv4l2Q\n","slug":"market-wrap-2","content":"<p>European equities are now climbing after a weak start, with investors shrugging off a poor session in Asia propelled by China's GDP slowing to a half-decade low.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Euro Stoxx benchmark is up 0.5 per cent, or 15 points, while in New York futures point to a slight rise for the S&amp;P 500.<\/p>\n\n<p>The upward moves follow a sell-off in Asia after China posted a 7.3 per cent growth rate in the third quarter.
