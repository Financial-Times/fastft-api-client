The increase would affect about half of Ikea's retail workers in the US. <\/p>\n\n<p>The increase comes after a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/7e5cd544-e1c6-11e3-915b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz35ixe1VzA\">spat of protests<\/a> across the US over minimum wage and after Barack Obama called income inequality \"the defining issue of our time\". <\/p>\n\n<p>The company noted that the hourly wage would vary based on the cost of living in different US locations, but the 17 per cent rise would take its average minimum wage to $3.51 above the federal minimum wage. <\/p>\n\n<p>The rate of increase was based on the MIT Living Wage Calculator, which takes housing ,food, medical and transportation costs into account along with taxes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ikea said it would be a \"significant investment\" but would not increase Ikea prices. <\/p>\n\n<p>The change applies only to retail workers, it said, because all \"non-retail locations - including five distribution centers, two service centers and a manufacturing facility - have hourly wage jobs that are already paying minimum wages above the local living wage.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Rob Olson, US acting president and CFO, said <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The transition to the new minimum hourly wage structure is not only the right thing to do, it makes good business sense.

With the Indian government showing a greater resolve for fiscal consolidation, there is a strong case for encouraging PSBs to approach capital markets for meeting their additional capital requirements under pillars I and II of Basel III.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","abstract":"<p>India's central bank may have supported the new government by holding interest rates on hold but it isn't going to pretend everything is rosy, as Narendra Modi takes the reins in New Delhi promising to revive growth in Asia's third largest economy.<\/p>","datepublished":"1403785481","authorpseudonym":"Robin Wigglesworth","currentrevision":4655602,"attachments":[],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"86032"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"Economy","id":86032,"tagid":86032,"tx":"Topic","txprefix":"topic","txid":4000,"query":"topic:Economy","classname":"red-2"},{"tag":"Banks","id":88842,"tagid":88842,"tx":"Sector","txprefix":"sector","txid":4010,"query":"sector:Banks","classname":null},{"tag":"India","id":98362,"tagid":98362,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:India","classname":null},{"tag":"Narendra Modi","id":124242,"tagid":124242,"tx":"Person","txprefix":"person","txid":4020,"query":"person:\"Narendra Modi\"","classname":null}],"uuidv3":"721a8b18-dbed-3d5a-8db4-938954e86a64","sortval":"0-0-01403785481"},{"id":172862,"title":"Bulgaria selling first eurobond in two years","type":"article","status":"live","url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/fastft?post=172862","shorturl":"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/1pRDJBC\n","content":"<p>The EU's poorest member state has attracted \u20ac3.75bn in orders for a bond expected to be north of \u20ac1bn in size against a choppy financial and political backdrop, <strong>reports Elaine Moore<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The euro-denominated September 2024 bond sale was launched on Thursday and is expected to be priced later this afternoon.
