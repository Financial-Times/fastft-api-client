What to make of the latest offering?<\/p>\n\n<p>First, the Swiss investment banking and wealth management group's SFr700m second-quarter loss was not as bad as expected, even after it paid SFr1.6bn (after tax) in May and pleaded guilty to settle a probe into whether it helped US clients to evade taxes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now to the bright spots. Its performance in fixed income, commodities and currencies or Ficc trading was better than expected, as revenues rose by about 4 per cent - bucking the Wall Street trend (down 9 per cent on average) - as investors lap up yield products in a classic case of make hay while you can.<\/p>\n\n<p>Investors need to reflect on the quality \u2013 including the sustainability - of that beat, however. As quantitative easing is unwound, the cheap money chasing yield in Europe could soon crumble. Wisely, Credit Suisse is already pulling out of its sub-scale commodities trading activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>A pity then that Credit Suisse's core equities franchise reported such a dip (more than 18 per cent off last year's admittedly high base) in equity trading revenues in the business being kept, standing out as one of the main drags on underlying earnings.<\/p>\n\n<p>And costs in the investment banking area are still relatively high \u2013 a reminder that Credit Suisse CEO Brady Dougan still has more to do to restructure his bank \u2013 though there is clear progress in automation of foreign exchange trading and rationalisation of its rates products.<\/p>\n\n<p>And while Credit Suisse looks to be on track to hit its end-2015 cost reduction target of over SFr4.5bn, it may need to add more stretch to those targets given the uncertainty in investment banking markets. No cigar yet for the investment bankers, then.<\/p>\n\n<p>That leaves Credit Suisse's private banking and wealth franchise to support the group \u2013 or not, as it turns out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although it attracted SFr10bn of net inflows \u2013 a level not surpassed since the first quarter of 2013 - revenue in the area that is increasingly being shaped as the group's core (\u00e0 la UBS) slipped by a worse than expected 9 per cent in the business being kept.<\/p>\n\n<p>It gets worse: Credit Suisse's closely-watched gross margin fell again \u2013 to a worse-than-expected 99 basis points, from 112bp a year ago, partly as assets under management swelled.<\/p>\n\n<p>And though Credit Suisse's peer-lagging Basel III capital ratio of 9.5 per cent looks on track to beat 10 per cent by year-end, Mr Dougan still needs to shrink leverage in his investment bank. Risk-weighted assets, for example, declined only to SFr279bn from SFr281bn a year earlier. All the more reason to keep up property and non-core asset sales.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cigar box is still firmly shut.<\/p>","abstract":"<p>Credit Suisse's results are invariably a mixed bag \u2013 and just as invariably, with their array of \"core strategic\" and \"core non-strategic\" results, they are presented as such.

deal","type":"article","status":"live","url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/fastft?post=184522","shorturl":"http:\/\/on.ft.com\/Wva3Qh\n","content":"<p>It was a classic Saudi announcement: years of rumours and inertia, followed by an unheralded, obtuse statement in Arabic on the website of a state body that was so discrete that most media only picked up on its importance the day after it was posted.<\/p>\n\n<p>But Saudi Arabia planning to open up its $530bn stock market to foreigners is potentially a big deal \u2013 for both the country and emerging markets as a whole.<\/p>\n\n<p>The country's Capital Markets Authority has allowed foreign investors indirect access through \"total return swaps\" since 2008, but many money managers have been reluctant to use these derivatives, as they only entitle the holders to the economic benefits of share ownership, rather than actual control.<\/p>\n\n<p>Direct access, through a China-style \"qualified foreign financial institutions\" system, could be a game-changer. The Saudi Arabian Tadawul has a market capitalisation of $530bn, making it a bigger stock market than Mexico, Indonesia and the Netherlands, in line with Malaysia and South Africa, and bigger than Colombia and Chile combined. <\/p>\n\n<p>If it is eventually included in stock market indices, it would become an important part of benchmarks. Renaissance Capital's Daniel Salter estimates that it would form almost two-thirds of the MSCI Frontier Markets index, or 4.4 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Markets gauge, about the same as Russia. <\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Saudi Arabia's market is extremely liquid for a recondite, off-piste bourse. Renaissance Capital's Charles Robertson puts the three-month average daily trading volume at $2bn, compared to just $26m for Nigeria last year. <\/p>\n\n<p>The dominance of retail investors means that it is an exceptionally volatile market, but part of the reason why Saudi Arabia is now opening up is that it hopes more longer-term institutional investment will dampen the Tadawul's wild swings. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since a brutal crash in 2006 \u2013 which bankrupted many Saudis who had ploughed their savings into the bourse, and triggered some social strife \u2013 the regulator has sharpened its teeth and clamped down on pump-and-dump schemes, insider trading and other market abuses. The CMA is now one of the more respected regulators in the Gulf. <\/p>\n\n<p>Adding to the lustre is Saudi Arabia's economic potential. Although oil remains the country's dominant industry and source of revenue, the government is ploughing money into various parts of the economy to diversify its output. <\/p>\n\n<p>The exact timing remains unclear, and Saudi Arabia has a tendency to move slowly. Local officials indicated an opening up to the FT in 2012, but little happened. But the potential is immense. As Mr Robertson noted:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is long awaited and is likely to see a surge of foreign inflows into the Saudi market \u2013 particularly if\/when it joins an MSCI index. It is a rival for money that might otherwise be invested in Russia, which is one reason Rencap is opening up in MENA in 2014.

entrepreneur, has agreed to sell one of his listed property companies to Blackstone Real Estate Partners in a \u00a3448m deal, but insists that he is not calling the top of London's commercial property market, <strong>reports Claer Barrett<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aim-listed Max Property Group, which was set up in 2009 to take advantage of weak conditions in the UK commercial property market, was the largest European IPO of that year raising \u00a3211m from investors including Och-Ziff, the US hedge fund.<\/p>\n\n<p>It was originally conceived as a seven-year vehicle, but Mr Leslau and his long-term business partner Mike Brown said they had no qualms about selling up two years ahead of plan.<\/p>\n\n<p>The valuation reflects a 22 per cent premium to net asset value (NAV) reported in the group's annual report in March, before management incentive provisions and exit costs, and reflects a 112 per cent increase in NAV over the five years since Max was listed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mr Leslau said:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are we calling the top? Absolutely not. As Baron Rothschild once said, I got rich by selling early. Blackstone has massive financial resources and has made a knockout bid, so we've gone earlier than we thought.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>I do think the market is discounting all risk at the moment, and there is undoubtedly an exuberance out there. That's not to say it isn't justified, but we have a seven year life cycle. We've been offered tomorrow's jam today, so we took the decision to get out.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The deal will see MPG opco, a wholly owned subsidiary of Max which owns the entire property business of the group, sold for \u00a3414.2m in cash. The price excludes a \u00a333m cash dividend being returned by the company to shareholders on Wednesday.<\/p>\n\n<p>The sale must be approved by more than 50 per cent of shareholders at an emergency general meeting on August 11, but the company said holders representing 46 per cent of the shares had already undertaken to vote in favour. <\/p>\n\n<p>This includes Och-Ziff, which owns a 16 per cent stake, and Prestbury, Mr Leslau's main company which owns 11 per cent.<\/p>\n\n<p>The incentive arrangements put in place at the time of Max's listing, requiring the company to return the original \u00a3211m capital plus returns equivalent to 11 per cent per annum, have been met under the terms of the deal. <\/p>\n\n<p>This will trigger an incentive payment of \u00a340.3m to the management team and Och-Ziff, who were the company's cornerstone investor, following the completion of the deal.<\/p>\n\n<p>The net cash return to shareholders is expected to be 184.2p per share, representing a premium of nearly 19 per cent to yesterday's closing price.<\/p>","abstract":"<p>Nick Leslau, the property entrepreneur, has agreed to sell one of his listed property companies to Blackstone Real Estate Partners in a \u00a3448m deal, but insists that he is not calling the top of London's commercial property market, <strong>reports Claer Barrett<\/strong>.<\/p>","datepublished":"1406014609","authorpseudonym":"Robin Wigglesworth","currentrevision":4870192,"attachments":[],"metadata":{"primarytagid":"113002"},"issticky":false,"tags":[{"tag":"Greater London","id":98292,"tagid":98292,"tx":"Location","txprefix":"location","txid":4030,"query":"location:\"Greater London\"","classname":null},{"tag":"Blackstone","id":101782,"tagid":101782,"tx":"Company","txprefix":"company","txid":4050,"query":"company:Blackstone","classname":null},{"tag":"Companies","id":113002,"tagid":113002,"tx":"Sector","txprefix":"sector","txid":4010,"query":"sector:Companies","classname":"blue-2"},{"tag":"AIM","id":131282,"tagid":131282,"tx":"Institution","txprefix":"institution","txid":4040,"query":"institution:AIM","classname":null},{"tag":"Commercial real estate","id":132202,"tagid":132202,"tx":"Sector","txprefix":"sector","txid":4010,"query":"sector:\"Commercial real estate\"","classname":null}],"uuidv3":"43f1ed1a-ca50-305c-a845-5e6712361943","sortval":"0-0-01406014609"}],"srh":{"query":{"id":1001,"str":"","url":"","obj":null,"hash":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"},"sort":"date","limit":10,"offset":0,"dispopts":[]},"resultsummarytext":"16,887 results","total":16887,"filters":{"4000":{"id":4000,"name":"Topic","plural":"Topics","terms":{"1":{"tagid":"86032","freq":3339,"type":"inresults","tag":"Economy","term":"topic:Economy","isprotected":0},"0":{"tagid":"86352","freq":4130,"type":"inresults","tag":"Markets","term":"topic:Markets","isprotected":0}},"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4010":{"id":4010,"name":"Sector","plural":"Sectors","terms":[{"tagid":"113002","freq":7626,"type":"inresults","tag":"Companies","term":"sector:Companies","isprotected":0},{"tagid":"88632","freq":249,"type":"inresults","tag":"Retail","term":"sector:Retail","isprotected":0}],"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4020":{"id":4020,"name":"Person","plural":"People","terms":{"1":{"tagid":"89052","freq":129,"type":"inresults","tag":"Ben Bernanke","term":"person:\"Ben Bernanke\"","isprotected":0},"0":{"tagid":"114882","freq":163,"type":"inresults","tag":"Janet Yellen","term":"person:\"Janet Yellen\"","isprotected":0}},"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4030":{"id":4030,"name":"Location","plural":"Locations","terms":{"1":{"tagid":"98262","freq":1581,"type":"inresults","tag":"Asia","term":"location:Asia","isprotected":0},"0":{"tagid":"119052","freq":2422,"type":"inresults","tag":"US","term":"location:US","isprotected":0}},"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4040":{"id":4040,"name":"Institution","plural":"Institutions","terms":{"1":{"tagid":"100282","freq":251,"type":"inresults","tag":"ECB","term":"institution:ECB","isprotected":0},"0":{"tagid":"113542","freq":323,"type":"inresults","tag":"Federal Reserve","term":"institution:\"Federal Reserve\"","isprotected":0}},"iscomplete":false,"summary":""},"4050":{"id":4050,"name":"Company","plural":"Companies","terms":[{"tagid":"101432","freq":202,"type":"inresults","tag":"Apple","term":"company:Apple","isprotected":0},{"tagid":"101332","freq":175,"type":"inresults","tag":"RBS","term":"company:RBS","isprotected":0}],"iscomplete":false,"summary":""}}}}]
