But DCC's stand-out characteristic is its return on capital employed, the benchmark that Tommy Breen, chief executive, says is the company's most important.</p>\n\n<p>Given that its cost of capital is \"in the mid single digits\", he says, DCC's return on capital employed of just over 16 per cent in the year to March looks impressive. This is a continuation of a trend in place almost since DCC became a listed company 20 years ago, and is driven by profit growth and capital management.</p>\n\n<p>That profit growth is in turn driven by acquisitions. DCC makes frequent bolt-on acquisitions to add to its core divisions. Already this year it has bought a healthcare business in the UK for an enterprise value of £13m, and a petrol distribution company in Sweden for £40m.</p>\n\n<p>DCC has plenty of ammunition to maintain that strategy and perhaps do bigger acquisitions, given that it has almost no debt and generated free cash flow of £225m in the year to March. Given its position in the energy distribution market, investors should probably expect more on that front. </p>\n\n<p>\"Given what is going on in the energy markets, the pace of divestment is likely to quicken. That is a sweet spot for us,\" Mr Breen tells the FT.</p>",

Nonetheless, most members seem content to leave policy on hold for some time to absorb the slack in the economy.</p>\n  \n  <p>While the minutes of May's UK MPC meeting strike a slightly less dovish tone than last week's Inflation Report, they still suggest that the first rise in interest rates remains a distant prospect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From ING:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With the growth story broadening out we are getting closer to a rate rise from the Bank of England. </p>\n  \n  <p>Our house view remains that the first hike will probably come in February, but given the strength in growth, employment and asset prices the risks are skewed towards a slightly earlier move. If we see wages growth pick up – note the impending 3 per cent rise in national minimum wage and the increase in reported pay awards – then we would be more inclined to bring it forward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From INS Global Insight:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are clear indications in the May minutes that some of the more hawkish MPC members are starting to get twitchy.</p>\n  \n  <p>For the time being, we retain the view that interest rates are most likely to start edging up in the second quarter of 2015, but there is clearly a very real and growing likelihood that the Bank of England will act before then. </p>\n  \n  <p>The uncertain outlook for when the first interest rate hike will come is heightened by the fact that three members of the MPC are changing by August, with May's meeting being the swansong for Spencer Dale. Paul Fisher and Charlie Bean will also shortly be leaving the MPC.</p>\n</blockquote>",

New opportunities abound thanks to \"under-penetrated markets\". Luckily, Mr Bailey has a strong platform to build on as the luxury group's \"dynamic management\", which has driven \"outperformance\". </p>\n\n<p>Mr Bailey has the advantage of taking over a company that is growing faster than its peers. Burberry has also moved into online sales quicker than rivals, who still regard online sales with apprehension, and has been unaffected by the slowdown in China's luxury goods market.</p>\n\n<p>But challenges remain. Burberry has dragged its beauty business in-house in contrast to its rivals who tend to license out their brands to bigger perfume purveyors. Cracking Japan, the world's second largest luxury market, via a relaunch of the brand could also prove treacherous, but has the potential to be extremely lucrative. Burberry took its Chinese business in-house in 2010 to great success. </p>",

Against that, if productive potential were in part related\n  to the level of demand, then the earlier policy was tightened the greater the risk of incurring a\n  substantial cost in foregone output.</p>\n  \n  <p>Committee members placed different weights on these considerations and this was reflected in a\n  variety of views on the appropriate path of monetary policy.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Committee would continue to refine\n  its views as the economy evolved, and for some members the monetary policy decision was becoming\n  more balanced. </p>\n  \n  <p>In terms of the immediate policy decision, however, all members agreed that, in the\n  absence of other inflationary pressures, it would be necessary to see more evidence of slack reducing\n  before an increase in Bank Rate would be warranted.</p>\n</blockquote>",
